Its ok but very average. In the restaurant they start out great, pulling the dough in front of you and prepping the pizza. If you get pepperoni, it goes on the bottom unless requested on top (I personally would rather have burnt pepp then floppy wet). When done, the crust is overcooked and the toppings are not cooked enough, and yet the green peppers where mush, it seemed like they were precooked. The pizza is very salty. To the point where you can almost feel your mouth burning. I had to cover it with parm and red peppers to improve the taste. No specials. This was a walk in and cost $27.00 for a large deluxe (or whatever they called the works type),Though, I am visiting from Madison, WI (not far from Chicago) where we have dozens of fantastic pizza options almost all under $20.00 for a 16\" or larger single anything you want on it delivered, dine in or carry out.If this was the best the Sunnyvale area has to offer, I can understand why so few people out here eat pizza. Most of the people I know in Sunnyvale have lived here over 20 years and none of them eat the pizza from around here. Bottom line for Giovannis, dont be fooled and dont bother, its not what your hoping it to be. Actually, it wasnt to far from a Pizza Hut hand tossed, except Pizza Hut wouldnt have mushy green peppers and the pepp wouldve been cooked correctly, and at 1\/2 the price.","lat":37.397389,"lon":-121.996719,"q":"9","distance":"2.90","accountid":"","source_listing_id":"","chainid":"","detailurl":"http:\/\/local.yahoo.com\/info-21341983-giovannis-pizzaria-sunnyvale","bppurl":"http:\/\/local.yahoo.com\/info-21341983-giovannis-pizzaria-sunnyvale","website":"http:\/\/giovannisnypizza.com\/","websitelabel":"http:\/\/giovannisnypizza.com\/","featuredurl1":{"label":"","content":""},"featuredurl2":{"label":"","content":""},"facebookurl":"","twitterurl":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/godaddy","lodresurl":"","lodreslabel":"Reserve Now","loddetailurl":"","loddetaillabel":"Read More on Yahoo Travel","reviewurl":"http:\/\/local.yahoo.com\/info-21341983-giovannis-pizzaria-sunnyvale","readreviewsurl":"http:\/\/local.yahoo.com\/info-21341983-giovannis-pizzaria-sunnyvale","slogan":"","eltagtext":"","eltagurl":"","eid":{"count":7,"content":[{"name":"AMACAI","id":"5692202"},{"name":"PSOXREVIEWS","id":"21341983"},{"name":"PSOXMENUITEMS","id":"21341983"},{"name":"SDE","id":"6809029191113a8a7ded01159be91251,707fdbaf3268d1eb2a2bcc31655929b7,f8b2d63b79a8f8e55848cb42cbf374e2,b38cc12c2bde634a037990cb52a59fa0,284c634a896a47edee8b2c0f119d0235"},{"name":"PSOXSOCIALURL","id":"21341983"},{"name":"INFOUSA","id":"494231418"},{"name":"SINGLEPLATFORM","id":"giovannis-pizzaria"}]},"ambiance":"","feature":"","price":"","symbolic_price":"","overview_toc":"7,19,22,23,36,37,40,42,46,48,52,72,73,74,88,91","hours":"Sun: closed, Mon: 11:00am - 09:30pm, Tue: 11:00am - 09:30pm, Wed: 11:00am - 09:30pm, Thu: 11:00am - 09:30pm, Fri: 11:00am - 09:30pm, Sat: 11:00am - 09:30pm","parking":"","smoking":"","dresscode":"","cuisine":"","menu":{"label":"","content":"http:\/\/www.singlepage.com\/giovannis-pizzaria\/menu?ref=yahoo"},"brands":"","products_services":"","reservationurl":"","reservationpolicy":"","thumbnail_photos":{"count":"0"},"fullsize_photos":{"count":"7","content":[{"url":"http:\/\/local-fe.zenfs.com\/filo\/21341983\/sr_cc0b4263a98d4e.jpg","width":"500","height":"375"},{"url":"http:\/\/local-fe.zenfs.com\/filo\/21341983\/sr_1e0c59411485e0.jpg","width":"500","height":"375"},{"url":"http:\/\/local-fe.zenfs.com\/filo\/21341983\/sr_9164daaacd24b2.jpg","width":"500","height":"375"},{"url":"http:\/\/local-fe.zenfs.com\/filo\/21341983\/sr_609a4cff1a907c.jpg","width":"500","height":"364"},{"url":"http:\/\/local-fe.zenfs.com\/filo\/21341983\/sr_47edb2b6196ae7.jpg","width":"500","height":"357"},{"url":"http:\/\/local-fe.zenfs.com\/filo\/21341983\/sr_4637451267af22.jpg","width":"500","height":"375"},{"url":"http:\/\/local-fe.zenfs.com\/filo\/1sr_1342938463_1342938463.jpg","width":"479","height":"360"}]},"menu_item_hits":["Cheese <hi>Pizza<\/hi>","<hi>Pizza<\/hi> Steak","cheesy <hi>pizza<\/hi>"]},{"id":"21332026","type":"POI","title":"Vitos Famous <b>Pizza<\/b>","dtitle":"Vitos Famous Pizza","addr":"1155 Reed Ave","city":"Sunnyvale","state":"CA","zip":"94086","crossstreet":"Between Willow Ave and Lawrence Expy","hideaddr":"","phone":"(408) 246-8800","dphone":"4082468800","paid":"N","isopen":"na","disphoo":"","listing_status":{"score":"100","content":"open"},"csubmitclosed":"false","closed_business":{"count":"0","content":"0"},"corrections":{"count":"2","content":"1"},"bizcard":"1","hiconf":"1","ycatsprimary":[{"ycat":"96926243","name":"Pizza"}],"ycat":[{"ycat":"96926236","name":"Restaurants"},{"ycat":"96926243","name":"Pizza"},{"ycat":"96926190","name":"Italian Restaurants"}],"ycatfull":"96926236 96926243 96926190 96925836 96925680","desc":"","rating":"4.5","nrating":"17","nreview":"17","latestreviewtime":"1309437030","latestreview":" and remembered that the pizza was pretty darn good, especially after a long day in The Caves of Steel.
